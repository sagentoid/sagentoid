My first project

This webpage was created for educational purposes. As I continue to improve on my HTML5/CSS3 skills, the more innovative improvements
I will make to the page.  Notice that I've created an interactive website using bootstrap, you can too!

Goal:  To create a website worthy of admiration using all the different techniques, to include javascript and advanced CSS3 integrating bootstrap, flexbox, etc.
